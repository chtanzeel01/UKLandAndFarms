# UKLandAndFarms
In this web scraping project, I undertook the task of collecting valuable data from the UKLandandFarms website, which specializes in providing information about land and farms available for sale in the United Kingdom. The goal was to gather comprehensive data on various properties listed on the website and store it in a structured CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format for further analysis.

Project Steps:

Data Collection: I utilized web scraping techniques, primarily using Python and popular libraries like Beautiful Soup and Requests, to extract information from the UKLandandFarms website. This involved sending HTTP requests to the site, parsing HTML content, and navigating through multiple pages to scrape data systematically.

Data Fields: I identified the key data fields of interest, which may include property name, location, price, acreage, property type, and any additional details available on the website.

Pagination Handling: UKLandandFarms likely has multiple pages of property listings. I implemented pagination handling to scrape data from all available pages, ensuring that no listings were missed.

CSV Storage: The cleaned data was then saved into a CSV file. This file structure allowed for easy storage, sharing, and further analysis of the collected data.
